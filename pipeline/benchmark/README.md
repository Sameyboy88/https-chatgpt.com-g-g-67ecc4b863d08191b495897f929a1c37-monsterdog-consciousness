# Benchmark Submission Component

## Purpose
Evaluates and scores processed artifacts against standardized performance metrics before proceeding to NFT bundling.

## Evaluation Metrics

### Quantum Coherence Tests
- **Coherence Stability**: Measures quantum state consistency
- **Entanglement Preservation**: Evaluates information preservation
- **Decoherence Resistance**: Tests robustness against environmental noise

### Fractal Compression Efficiency
- **Compression Ratio**: Data reduction achieved
- **Information Loss**: Quality degradation measurement  
- **Reconstruction Fidelity**: Accuracy of decompressed data

### Temporal Consistency
- **Chronological Ordering**: Temporal sequence validation
- **Causality Preservation**: Cause-effect relationship integrity
- **Timeline Coherence**: Multi-dimensional time alignment

### Dimensional Integrity
- **Spatial Consistency**: Dimensional mapping accuracy
- **Boundary Preservation**: Edge case handling
- **Scale Invariance**: Performance across dimensional scales

## Benchmark Scores

Artifacts are scored on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 for each metric:
- **0.9-1.0**: Excellent (proceed to NFT bundling)
- **0.7-0.89**: Good (optimization recommended)
- **0.5-0.69**: Fair (requires improvement)
- **<0.5**: Poor (reject or reprocess)

## Submission Process
1. Artifact validation
2. Metric evaluation
3. Score calculation
4. Quality gate assessment
5. Results logging
6. Pipeline routing decision

## Configuration
Benchmark thresholds and weights are configurable in `config/benchmark.json`.
